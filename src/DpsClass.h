/**
 * Arduino library to control Dps310
 *
 * "Dps310" represents Infineon's high-sensetive pressure and temperature sensor. 
 * It measures in ranges of 300 - 1200 hPa and -40 and 85 째C. 
 * The sensor can be connected via SPI or I2C. 
 * It is able to perform single measurements
 * or to perform continuous measurements of temperature and pressure at the same time, 
 * and stores the results in a FIFO to reduce bus communication. 
 *
 * Have a look at the datasheet for more information.
